The Historical Serials project

This repository contains the PDFs, the raw OCR, and the text being processed, of historic serial publications from the long eighteenth century.

The first aim is to build a collection of such material that is clearly in the public domain, for the free use and re-use by anyone at all.

The second aim is to curate this collection, creating useful metadata about the publications.

Further aims will be added as I develop this project.
