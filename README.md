The Historic Serials project

historicserials.uk coming soon

This repository will contains the PDFs, the raw OCR, and the metadata, of historic serial publications published in Britain, in the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and freely and openly available as public domain material.

The first task is to map out what is freely available and where it is held;

the second task will be to produce and curate metadata;

and the third task - the most difficult - will be to produce viable digital text from these printed publications.

All outputs will be freely and openly available and accessible.
